Multilayer perceptron model is a class of artificial neural network that uses back propagation technique for training. 
It has three layers of nodes. The hidden layer has 4, the input layer has 3 and the output layer has 6 neurons. 
During training, all the weights and biases are updated after processing single training sample and the method is called stochastic training. 
The update rule uses learning rate of 0.1 and momentum factor of 0.001. The code is run for 1500 epochs. The activation function is sigmoid 
of the form f(x) = 1 / 1 + exp(-x) Its range is between 0 and 1. It is S â€” shaped curve.  The performance of classification is measured using 
confusion matrix. The code computes accuracy.
